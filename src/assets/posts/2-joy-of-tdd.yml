title: The Joy of Test Driven Development
synopsis: >
  or...How I learned to stop worrying and love test failures.  I was skeptical at first, but I have since come to
  enjoy the experience of writing tests prior to putting together even a single line or working code.  Take a look at
  exactly what the process entails, the potential benefits, pitfalls and why I love working this way.
