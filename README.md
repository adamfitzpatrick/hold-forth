__raging-goblin__ is the UI application for www.stepinto.io.  The site implements Angular 4, and is written entirely in
TypeScript.  Continuous integration and testing is provided by Travis CI, which fails all builds that do not include
100% unit test coverage.  End-to-end testing is implemented using Protractor.

Future development includes:
- Implementation of a simple user login and commenting system
- Implementation of behavior-driven testing utilizing Gherkin language to drive E2E testing
- Compliance with WCAG 2.0 standards for accessibility.
